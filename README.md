# ipython-notebooks
IPython notebooks used for interactive learning.

These IPython notebooks were created for educational/self-educational purposes.

Please, feel free to use/copy/modify/distribute these notebooks. I only ask
that you credit me with authorship.

## Use

Most notebooks may be viewed in their static HTML form for those unfamiliar with 
Jupyter/IPython notebooks.

These notebooks were made using Python 3.5, but most notebooks should work with
Python 2.7 as well.

At the time of writing this README, only InteractiveDistributions absolutely
requires a local jupyter notebook setup. 

To install jupyter, I recommend installing either Miniconda or Anaconda.
Detailed directions may be found here: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

Installing Anaconda should provide all necessary dependencies, but an explicit list of 
dependencies used in these notebooks may be found in 'dependencies.txt'

Once conda is installed, installation of these dependencies is as easy as:

```
$ conda install --file dependencies.txt
```
